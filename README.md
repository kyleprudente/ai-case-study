	** Founded in 2011 by Jack Kokko and Raj Neervannan, AlphaSense is a market intelligence company that has developed an artificial intelligence driven search engine that aims to provide market intelligence and data analysis for financial corporations and firms. The company came about when the founders were conducting market research, manually and frustratingly combing through each financial document for an insight. After several years, the founders saw that the tools and methodology for market research remained the same. They then launched AlphaSense in 2011 with the goal of aiding professionals to extract insights from numerous sources and data points. In September 2023, AlphaSense received $150 million from their Series E funding, bringing their valuation to $2.5 billion. Their intended customers are financial corporations and firms, where they’re currently servicing companies such as J.P. Morgan, Cardinal Health, 3M, and equity analysts. Despite being a relatively new company that has yet to go public, AlphaSense was named in Forbes AI 50, was recognized as a leader in market and competitive intelligence by top analyst firm Forrester, is one of INC.’s Best Workplaces, and its CEO Jack Kokko was named EY’s Entrepreneur of the year in New York in 2023.

	* In pursuit of providing an artificial intelligence driven search engine, AlphaSense utilizes several technologies such as Smart Synonyms, Document Trend Analysis, and Smart Summaries. When a user does a search on their platform, their search engine can access all relevant sources and insights in a single search by assessing the whole phrase and each word, evaluating the context and intent of the search, as well as synonyms in of the words in the search query, giving search results from similar searches by the user’s competitors. Their platform can also give a visualization of how often a topic is mentioned across sources over a given time period using their Document Trend Analysis tool. Finally, AlphaSense recently released their latest addition to their platform called Smart Summaries, which can give instant summaries and insights from financial documents, such as the earnings insights, bull or bear cases for other companies, and the strengths and weaknesses of other companies. A major company that is also in the field of market intelligence is Bloomberg with their Bloomberg terminal.

	Market intelligence has always played a pivotal role in business, and over the last 10 years, market intelligence has seen a major shift towards big data. With the last decade being the era of big data, it required new hardware utilizations for data computing such as distributed computing, which is spreading analytical calculations across multiple servers. This analyzes data in memory which accelerates times-to-answer, making it possible for organizations to acquire large amounts of computing power for short periods at low cost.
